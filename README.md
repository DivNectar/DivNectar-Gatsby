This is the source for my personal website, DivNectar. DivNectar at it's heart is a blog, that is staticaly generated by Gatsby.js using MDX (markdown with jsx support) to render it's posts. The pages use regular .tsx. Feel free to use this code as a basis for your own website, I just please ask that if you do use my code, throw me a small attribution at the bottom of your site to spread my name :b 

The main goal of the website is to educate beginner developers on the in's and out's of programming. I truly hope that someone learns something from my site! 

Like the site? Suggest an improvement? Feel free to shoot me an email at sewdohe@divnectar.com
