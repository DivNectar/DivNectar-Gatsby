# Neocode

  Neocode is a "project" I started almost a year ago. My main goal was to create a "one click" install 
and auto-config of Neovim that is suitable for being productive with a minmal learning curve for new users.
It's my opinion that one of the biggest barriers to overcome as a new user is configuring everything
that an editor like Neovim has to offer. Most users would like something familiar.

  Neocode's keybinds are heavily inspired from VS code where possible, such as ctrl+p for fuzzy-finding files
in a project, and being able to save with ctrl+s instead of having to enter command mode. The editor also offers
lots of mouse functionality for users who are new to keboard-centric development, such as closing tabs with the mouse
or browsing the file tree with it. The editor also features a "keybinds legend" that you can invoke using crtl+k
where you can search for commands and also view thier keybinds.

The editor offers a command line installer for all three major operating systems as a pre-built binary. The installer
is built using rust and compiled for each system. It has various flags you can pass to it during installation
which offer various levels of set up, all the way to installing the package manager and text editor by itself.

## So why should I use it?

  Working with your keyboard provides not only a noticable speed improvement when developing, but it also
provides a level of badassery unrivaled by other editors. Let your friends and co-workers watch in awe as you
masterfully manipulate entire documents with the ease of a river flowing. Get closer to your work, and stay in
the "flow" state better by keeping your hands from getting distracted. They have one job: translate your thoughts
to code as fast as possible...and I believe that keeping your hands on the keyboard does just that.
