# Definitive Guide to Pixel 5 Rooting / Custom Roms

Custom ROMs...ahh, the beatuty of AOSP (Android Open Sourcce Project), of which most custom ROMs are based upon. Either that, or Lineage os (for the most part). I, myself, am a big fan of Kdrag0n's custom ROM, ProtonAOSP. It's a custom ROM built for simplicity, speed, and efficency. I'm quite active on the telegram group, and I see alot of people who are unsure of how to go about flashing a custom ROM, much less rooting said ROM and getting Safteynet working. What's that you ask? I've heard that alot as of late. So, to begin, I want to go over some common terminology related to rooting, custom ROMs, and flashing. So, let's get started!

## Who is this guide for?
This guide is for anyone who wants to learn more about the Android customization scene. I will admit, it's mostly geared twards Pixel owners, as these devices are very close to stock android. Other devices, like the OnePlus phones, as well as Samsung phones, contain many many tweaks and customizations from the manufacturers, and tend to cause issues when using the methods listed here. This guide can still be useful to you in understanding the broader picture, however.

## Platform tools
Before you can think of doing anything to your phone, you need to set up your pc to work on it first. To make changes to our Android phones, we need whats called the "Platform Tools". So, I figure before we do anything else, let's make sure that we can connect to the phone though ADB and Fastboot.

### Installing the tools

#### Linux
The installation method varies between linux distros.

**Debian/Ubuntu/POP OS/ Zorin/ (most) Users**
```sh sudo apt-get install android-tools-adb```

**Fedora / Opensuse Users**
```sh sudo yum install android-tools```

**Arch Linux Users**
I'm sure you already know what to do...

#### Windows
1. Download the (latest version of the android SDK platform tools) [https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-windows.zip]
2. Extract the zip folder somewhere easy to get too (e.x. C:\platform-tools)
3. open your windows start menu and type "env" and select the change env variables options
4. find the entry called PATH, and double click it. A new window will open with multiple entries
5. click add new entry on the right hand side and enter the folder path where you extracted the files (e.x. C:\platform-tools)
6. open a terminal window (i reccomend Windows terminal over cmd prompt) and type adb to make sure the command is recognized

## Terminology

### Rooting
Rooting is referring to having complete access to your phone. Normally, certian portions of the system are kept inaccessible to average users because there is the potential to break or even brick your system if these files are messed with. Being rooted means that some apps, or "modules" as Magisk refers to them, can now edit these system files to change how your operating system works on a lower level than your average app can. Take the Tasker app, for example. Without root, what you can do with the app is limited. Such is the case with other apps, such as the popular third-party launcher, Nova Launcher. Having root permissions means the app can do extra things, such as hiding the system clock at the top of the screen when on the launcher home.

### Magisk
Magisk is the currently accepted rooting method for Android. Back in the day we used an app called SuperSU, but it's not really supported anymore.

Currently, Magisk is in a strange state. It's undergoing lots of changes, due to it's maintainer, TopJonWu, being hired at Google as a security specialist. The project is in some sense a conflict of interest for him and his job, and is undergoing changes. With the latest version of Magisk Canary (the bleeding edge build of Magisk) the ability to hide magisk from system apps (such as google play services or banking apps) has been removed, and the underlying system providing a framework to make modules is changing to a new one called Zygisk. Already, modules are being updated to use Zygisk, and a new form of Magisk Hide is out called deny-list. We still have the same functionality that we've always had, just in a slightly different way. Don't panic people...

### Bootloader
Your hard drive (or more accuratley, SSD) in your phone consists of multiple partitions, or parts...just the same as your desktop PC. These partitions all come together to make the entire system. One of these partitions is called the bootlaoder, and it has the very important job of finding the starting point of your system and booting into it, so that the graphical enviorment can start up. Often times, phones are shipped with locked bootloaders and therefore cannot be modified. However, certian phones some with unlockable bootloaders. Pixel devices for the most part are all bootloader-unlocked, meaning we can toggle a setting that will allow us to unlock the bootloader, allowing us to potentially boot into a different system than came with the phone. Unlocking the bootloader is fairly simple, but in most cases will wipe all data on the phone. Sorry folks. 

### Safteynet
Safteynet is the big G's way to ensure device compatibility and security. It's job is basically to allow apps to check the integrity of the system's security to protect sensitive apps on your device such as banking apps and the tap-to-pay service. We are able to pass safteynet in most cases using the Magisk-Hide module located in the Magisk app in combination with a Safteynet fix module by the awesome platform dev Kdrag0n. Be sure to go support him on Patreon (you'll also recieve early access to new module and ROM releases).

### Custom ROM
A custom ROM is entirely different base system than your phone came with. Often times these custom ROMs have performance increases, custom settings/features, UI tweaks for a more beautiful system, custom default apps, and much, much more. These operating systems are generally pulled from a more general base operating system, 99% of the time pulled from either AOSP itself, or Lineage OS base. Using these custom ROMs are usually a give-and-take scenario. You will (most likley) no longer recieve OTA Updates and security patches. You will have to go through special procedures to update your device. Sometimes ROMs cannot support safteynet, and you can no longer use your tap and pay methods or banking apps, and even some play store games will detect you running a custom OS and refuse to let you play for fear of having a hack client. These are things that you must weigh out for yourself and decide if flashing a cusrom ROM is for **YOU**.

### ADB & Fastboot
ADB & Fastboot are the tunnels to our phones internal software. Using ADB & Fastboot we can flash img files to certian partitions (disk sectors) on the operating system, or flash multiple images and replace the operating system as a whole (i.e. flash a custom ROM) without ADB and Fastboot, you will not be able to root or flash a custom ROM. Let's dive a little into what each of these things are:

#### ADB
ADB stands for Android Debug Bridge. It allows us to do a plethora of things, including (but not limited to) installing and uninstalling apps, accesing hidden developer features, sending and pushing files, rebooting into recovery, fastboot, or the bootloader, and many many more things. In order to use ADB, you must first enable the developer tools in your settings.

#### Fastboot
Fastboot is a diagnostic tool which allows you to modify the file system of your Android device via your computer. It allows us to install custom firmware, recoveries, or modify existing ones. Fastboot will also allow us to boot into some .img files from the bootloader (such as a tempoary custom recovery)

## Unlocking the bootloader

### The steps
1. Ensure you've installed and checked your ADB & Fastboot are working correctly and detecting your device.
2. Enter your developer settings (or go to settings and type bootloader for the same result)
3. Tick the checkbox to enable OEM unlocking
4. Plug your device into your computer
5. open a terminal and enter ```sh adb reboot bootloader```
6. When the phone boots into the bootloader, enter ```sh fastboot flashing unlock```
7. Confirm on the phone using the indicated volume key that you would indeed, like to unlock the bootloader
8. That's it! Your phone will in all likleyhood reboot and now display a warning that the phone is unlocked during boot. The message will stay for about 5 seconds and then boot as Normally

Congratulations! You now have an unlocked bootloader! ðŸ¥³

## Rooting
Small steps first! Let's talk about how to root the stock ROM on the pixel 5. The steps are the same for any other pixel device as far as I know, but I cannot attest to that as the only other Pixel I'v ever owned was a bootloader-locked 3XL. 

### Rooting FAQ

#### What will rooting do to my phone?
Upon first rooting your phone, it will operate exactly the same as it does without root. Often times, root is an unneccessary feature that many people don't need. Only root if you have a theme/mod/app that requires root permission, otherwise you will go through all the steps for basically no reason. Sometimes, people need root on thier device in order to flash Magisk modules that allow for passing safteynet as well, so keep that in mind. But I can't recomend anyone root "just to be rooted".

#### What about updates?
Updates become somewhat of a hassle after rooting. Any OTA update that you take will write over the boot partition where the Magisk patch lives. So what do we do? In order to update, it's reccomended to update using fastboot as opposed to updating through the system update section. The whole goal when updating is to re-patch the boot.img and flash it before the first boot after an update, so none of your modules will break and you will still retain root before and after the update. So, like I said...a little more headache, but not too awful bad. I will detail the steps for updating below.
