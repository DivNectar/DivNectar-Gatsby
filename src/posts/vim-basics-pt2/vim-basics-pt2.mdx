# Vim -> Basic Motions & Text Objects

Welcome to part two of my vim basics tutorial. In the previous tutorial, we got neovim installed on your operating system of choice. Today, we are ready to get our fingers dirty! Let's get started.

## Basic Motions

So, when loading Vim, you're by default in "normal mode". This is vim's powerhouse editing mode, and this is where you will spend the majority of your time once you get familiar with Vim. This mode allows you to issue powerful commands to edit large selections of text at once, or to navigate the document quickly. We will cover modes more in depth in a later tutorial. Let's just focus on moving for right now. In Vim, there are two traditional ways of simple directional movements. They are as follows:

### Method 1 (N00b)

This way, you simple navigate using the arrow keys as you would in any editor.

### Method 2 (l33t)

This method uses the h,j,k, & l keys to move around the document. This method takes longer to learn, but is more efficent in the long run, because you never have to leave the home row keys while editing, saving you those precious seconds every time you need to navigate.

| Key | Direction |
| --- | --------- |
| h   | left      |
| j   | down      |
| k   | up        |
| l   | right     |

Throughout the tutorials, I will be using HJKL keys for directional movements, as it's just what I'm used too. I wish there was some pnumonic or magic trick that makes learning the HJKL keys any easier, but, unfortunatley it just takes time and practice. Lots of practice. I promise though, once you learn it it's all you will ever want to use!

## Motions

HJKL are great, really....but kinda powerless when compared to the featurelist of Vim. Things, however, get really efficent when you throw _motions_ into the mix. Motions generally employee pnumonics to make them easy to remember. Motions move your cursor or operate on text based on a text _object_.

As an example, try pressing the W key. You'll notice your cursor moves forward by one (W)ord text object. A (w)ord text object is defined by spaces and special characters. <kbd>F</kbd>
