I’ve been developing for the web for about 6 years, on/off. Over the past year, I have begun taking on real clients and providing custom webbapp solutions for businesses. Now I’m here, on my site, divnectar to take it to the next level and share my years of knowledge with other fine developers like myself. I have a passion for developer tooling (a.k.a. happiness), and I’m a firm beliver that taking miliseconds off your time adds up overall, but more importantly provides a feeling of bad-assery that you can’t get any other way. Seriously - coding while never taking your hands off the keyboard looks and feels awesome. I’ve been on the journey to a mouseless workflow for well over a year, and here I am today, still learning how to work these 80 keys that I have as effeciently as possible.

The following couple of posts will introduce you to the mouseless world - as easily as I possibly can. In the next post, we will see about installing and configuring the Vim mode extension for VS Code.
